# First thoughts simply looking at code
The ChatGPT code for the Mancala game is well-structured and clearly adheres to the principles of Object-Oriented Programming, with distinct responsibilities separated into individual classes. The consistent and clear naming conventions lets us understand easily the code's functionality. Additionally, the flexibility of the game setup is a good thing to note on, as the constructor parameters in MancalaGame allow for easy configuration of various game setups, enhancing the game's adaptability.

The game loop in TextUI is simple and well-structured, effectively managing the flow of the game, including player switching and winner determination. In summary, the code is a has good software practices.

# Are the variable and method names meaningful and descriptive? Give specific examples to support your observation. How could the variable and method names be improved?
The variable and method names in the ChatGPt code, are mostly meaningful and descriptive. For example, in the MancalaGame class, we have methods like getCurrentPlayer(), switchPlayer(), and makeMove(int pitIndex), where each name clearly indicates its functionality. Similarly, in the Player class, the method addStonesToStore(int stones) accurately describes its purpose.

However, there is could be minor room for improvement. In the Board class, the method moveStones(int startIndex, Player player) could be renamed to something more descriptive, such as moveStonesAndCapture, to better explain the capturing logic that is part of this method. Additionally, the variable name pitsPerPlayer could be improved to numPitsPerPlayer to more accurately reflect that it stores a numerical value. While the current naming conventions are decent, especially considering they were generated by ChatGPT, these minor enhancements could further improve the code's readability, making it even easier for future developers to understand and maintain the code.

However, it's worth noting that the addStones method in the Pit class and the addStones method in the Store class have the same name but different implications within the game's context. While they both add stones, one adds to a pit on the board, and the other adds to a player's store. This could potentially be confusing and might be improved by renaming the methods to be more descriptive.

# Does the code follow coding conventions and formatting standards? Has it made appropriate use of includes? Are static members used properly? Give specific examples of how you would improve the coding conventions used.
The code generated generally follows coding conventions and formatting standards. Each class is separate and has its proper imports, and method names and variables are written in camelCase, and indents are also proper. However, there are certain aspects that could possibly be improved. One aspect that could be improved is the use of package declarations and imports. While proper package declarations are used, the import statements could be more specific. For instance, instead of importing everything from the mancala package:

By using import mancala.*;

It would be better to import only the specific classes that are used:
import mancala.MancalaGame;
import mancala.Player;

A good practice is to only import the ones you need as it is less clear as to which classes within the package are being used, additionally, it uses up more space by importing the ones that are not needed. This enhances clarity and helps prevent potential naming conflicts. In terms of static members, there are no static member variables in the provided code. The only static method is main in the TextUI class, which is appropriate. Static elements should be used when necessary, they are not required in this case.

# Are the classes properly encapsulated? Are member variables private? Are accessor and mutator methods used? How could you improve the encapsulation of this code?
The classes in this implementation of the Mancala game are mostly well-encapsulated, with member variables declared as private and accessor and mutator methods provided where necessary, especially in the simpler classes such as Pit, Store, and Player.

The MancalaGame class could provide more accessor methods to allow external classes to query the state of the game without directly accessing its internal state. For example, methods like getPlayer1, getPlayer2, and getBoard could be added. Without it, the TextUI which actually implements the game would have a hard time dealing with implementing more complex aspects of the code.

Additionally, all methods are public. While there isnâ€™t inherently anything wrong with methods being public, there are potential issues that can arise. By exposing a method as public, you are essentially saying that it is okay for other classes to call this method, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the method is not designed to be used that way.

For example, in the Board class, the moveStones method is public. This method is integral to the game's functionality and is used by the MancalaGame class to make a move. However, by making this method public, any class could call moveStones, potentially leading to moves being made outside of the game's normal flow. In this specific case, since the MancalaGame class controls the game's flow and ensures that moves are made in the correct order, it might be more appropriate to make the moveStones method package-private, to prevent external classes from making moves directly on the board.

# Is there any duplication of code in this project? Are there methods that do essentially the same thing, or parts of the same thing that could be made into smaller methods?
No, there is no points of duplication of code in the project. Every piece of code has its own functionality and while not every method is used, there could be a point where it could be useful in future implementation. The one thing that could be improved is that the moveStones method currently handles moving the stones and the capturing logic. These could be separated into two distinct methods to improve clarity: This separation would make the code easier to understand and maintain, as each method would have a clear, single responsibility. The moveStones method would handle the logic of moving the stones, and the captureStones method would handle the logic of capturing stones from the opposite pit.

# Does each class and method have a single, obvious purpose or responsibility? Are there any long methods that should be broken up into smaller methods? Give specific examples of how you could improve the code with respect to responsibilities.
As mentioned above, Each class in the provided code has a clear and focused responsibility, which aligns with good object-oriented design principles. For example, the Player class is responsible for managing the player's information and store, while the Board class handles the game board's state and movements.

However, there are methods that could be broken down into smaller, more focused functions to improve readability and maintainability. A specific example is the moveStones method in the Board class. This method currently handles both moving the stones and the capturing of stones. These are two distinct responsibilities that could be separated into different methods.
# Functionality and correctness
The code demonstrates a basic understanding of the Mancala game setup by correctly initializing the stores and pits with the specified number of stones. The distribution of stones into the next pits also works as expected. However, there are several crucial functionalities that are either missing or incorrectly implemented, which greatly affects the game's correctness and overall enjoyment.

One of the major flaws in the implementation is that the stones are not deposited into the stores correctly. It seems to always skip the stores, no matter which player it is. Additionally, in a standard Mancala game, the last stone placed in an empty pit should capture the opponent's stones across from that pit and deposit them into the player's store. However, the code does not properly have this crucial capturing mechanism.

Additionally, the winner determination logic is flawed. The game declares a player as the winner as soon as they have more stones in their store, without considering the remaining stones on the board. This premature declaration of the winner does not align with the conventional rules of Mancala, where the game continues until all six pits on one player's side are empty.

There also isn't an attempt at coding the functionality if giving a player an extra turn if their last stone is in their store. The lack of implementation for granting a player an extra turn when their last stone lands in their store is another significant omission from the game's functionality. In standard Mancala rules, if a player's last stone lands in their own store, they are granted another turn.

n conclusion, while the game successfully establishes the necessary stores and pits and is able to distribute the stones correctly, it falls short in several crucial aspects of gameplay, such as the correct movement and depositing of stones, proper determination of the winner, and the implementation of extra turns when a player's last stone lands in their store.
